## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

- Tried to use semantic HTML5 markup. Not sure if the footer should've been reserved for the attribution-div included by frontendmentor.
- CSS flexbox.
- Struggled a bit with the pricing info, getting everything correctly placed. Ended up using CSS-grid.
- No clear structure on when to use rem, em or px for sizing.



### Continued development

So far the biggest challenge is layout and getting content properly placed.
I also feel that html markup probably could be better.
